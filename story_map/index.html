        <h1>Typhoon Haiyan</h1>
        <h4>The Red Cross Response<br> One Year On</h4>        
        <p>One year ago, Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines with unprecedented fury. A combination of cyclonic winds, heavy rains and tsunami-like storm surges crushed homes, destroyed livelihoods and infrastructure, and killed thousands of people. The effect on communities was devastating.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0_nC9YWqDQ" data-toggle="lightbox"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-film glyphicon-large"></span>&nbsp; IFRC in Action</a></p>
    
        <p>The Red Cross Red Crescent Movement began work immediately, distributing emergency relief to 1.3 million people in the worst affected areas and planning for a long-term recovery focused on shelter and livelihoods.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg0hvbP2G0w" data-toggle="lightbox"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-film glyphicon-large"></span>&nbsp; Cash in Emergencies</a></p>

        <h2>Maria</h2>
        <p>Mother of two Maria Redubla Liporada loves to make cakes, but it was only when she received about USD130 in livelihood support from Red Cross that she was able to realise her dream to set up a small bakery.</p> 

        <div class="modalLink" onclick="callImageModal(this);"  >
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/p-PHL2420_small.jpg"></div>
      

        <p>Maria and her family live in a remote upland community in Leyte called Anonang, which was hard hit by Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
        <p>The family was evacuated to higher ground before the typhoon to escape flooding from a nearby river.  When they returned, they found their house and belongings gone and most of their crops destroyed. They had very little left to eat.</p>
        <p>That time was tough for them all, Maria says.</p> 
        <p>‘During that time I felt a mixture of emotions. We had lost everything, but at the same time we were thankful to survive.’</p>
        <p>Not long after that Maria’s family and some other survivors left for Manila to seek a new life. By chance they saw an interview with the Philippine Red Cross chairman, Richard Gordon. He explained what the Red Cross was doing to distribute relief goods to people in need. That gave Maria and her family renewed hope, and they decided to return home. Once recovery work started, they were able to qualify for Red Cross livelihood support.</p>
        <p>These days, Maria gets up at 3 every morning to make her kakanin (cakes) and sells enough to make about USD10 a day. All the family savings go straight into the bank and will be used to rebuild their home and pay school fees.</p>
        <p>‘I want to thank Red Cross for giving me the opportunity to start a new life and a new business,’ she says.</p>
        <p>‘My message to other women is: don’t just sit at home – help your husband and together you will prosper.’</p>

        <h2>Restituto</h2>
        <p>Restituto B. Barroa is a 69 year-old resident of Ilawod Daga, Panay, Capiz and a tentant farmer. He is married to Elisa, and owns less than 1 hectare of cultivated land. Restituto has a famous reputation as an industrious man in his village, or barangay.</p>
        <p>When Typhoon Haiyan struck one year ago, it left Restituto’s farm in a dire condition. Although he could fix his house using salvaged materials, his source of family income - rice farming - was unsalvageable. And given his age, Restituto had no other source of income.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Red Cross selected the Barroa family to take part in their Livelihood Recovery Program, based on a nomination from the community. With the support he received from the Red Cross, Restituto is farming rice and the local bitter squash, “ampalaya.” He also purchased a pig. WIth a second payment, he bought 40 ducklings and another piglet.</p>
        <p>Now Restituto’s animals are growing, he sell his vegetables in their barangay and he already harvested 100 sacks of rice. From the income he generated, Restituto bought three more piglets and a few ducks.</p>
        <p>“Gapasalamat guid ko sa dako nga bulig nga ginhatag sang Philippine Red Cross kag gamiton ko ini sa insakto,” says Restituto, which roughly translates as “I am very thankful for what the Philippine Red Cross has given me. I promise I will use it properly.”</p>

        <h2>Estifana</h2>
        <p>Tenant farmer Estifana Rogan, 72, works hard hoeing the fertile soil in her family’s fruit and vegetable plantation.</p>
        <p>Estifana lives with her husband, Bermijo, and one adult son, who has Down’s syndrome.</p>
        <p>Pineapples, bananas, eggplants, sweet potatoes and green peppers flourish in this secluded valley in the inland barangay (village) of Ogsip, Libacao, on Panay Island.</p>
        <p>It’s hard to believe that a year ago typhoon Haiyan wiped out nearly everything the Rogans had. The roof of their house was blown off, a wall collapsed and all their poultry was killed.</p> 
        <p>Luckily, everyone in the Rogan household survived the horrific storm.</p>
        <p>Estifana says she used to worry how the family would survive without a source of food or income, apart from the emergency relief aid they received from Red Cross.</p>
        <p>Because of their difficult circumstances the family was selected by the local community’s barangay recovery committee for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s conditional cash for livelihoods programme, which offers up to 10,000 pesos (USD220) per household.</p>
        <p>‘With the 10,000 pesos we bought seedlings and fertilizers and we started to replant,’ Estifana says.</p>
        <p>It took the elderly couple 10 days to plant their crops and almost a month before the first fruit appeared. Now they hope to get back on their feet.</p>
        <p>‘We will save money and store food so that our house is already prepared for the next typhoon,’ Estifana says with a smile.</p>

        <h2>Fransisco</h2>
        <p>50 year-old Francisco Calinao is one of many survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, whose primary source of income was lost as a result of the disaster. With his 80 year-old mother and 19 year-old daughter to care for, Francisco began selling produce from his backyard to the nearby market so the family could meet their daily needs, including expenses for his daughter's schooling.</p>
        <p>Things changed for the better when Francisco was selected to be part of the Philippine Red Cross' Household Livelihood Assistance programme. As a landless laborer with a very small garden, when he received the 1st installment (Php. 6,000), Francisco began planting variety of vegetables. He also purchased fingerling Tilapia for his small pond, in order to maximize productivity and supplement his garden’s income. </p> 
        <p>While it is too early to assess the success of his investment to date, Francisco is grateful to the Philippine Red Cross for the assistance. It has given his entire family a solid opportunity to be more financially secure than before.</p>
        <p>“Gapasalamat ako sa ginbulig sang Philippine Red Cross tungod kay nakaumpisa ako liwat sa pangabuhi na mas maayo pa," says Francisco.</p>

        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/beron_temp_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>My name is Manuel Beron. I am 48 years old, I live in Barangay Biasong and I have 7 children. I used to be a farmer but these days I sell charcoal. I was born with a disability, I accepted this, I never look down on myself because this is the reality. It is given by God.</p> 
        <p>During Typhoon Yolanda, I felt like it was the last day of my life because of the strong winds. Yolanda broke my house. During the typhoon, we did not come to any rehabilitation centre, we just stayed at the house. All my chickens died. My vegetable plants were gone. That just scared me most; not for only myself, but also my children, and my wife.</p>
        <p>Now, I am very happy because of the shelter assistance that I received. I am happy because for the first time, I can repair my house. My family is more secure.  With these corrugated iron sheets, for the first time since Yolanda I have a roof over our heads. Without these iron sheets, we would still have no roof – only tarpaulins.</p> 
        <p>With this assistance from the Red Cross, I can now use my own money to buy food for my family. I do not need to spend that money to repair my home. Now I can see the Red Cross has the ability and the power to help Filipino people that need assistance.</p>

        <p>My name is Misalina Cabalquinto Jubos. I am a widow with two children – one is ten years old and another has his own family. My first husband left me when I lost my hand in a car accident while I was going to the hospital to immunize our son. My second husband passed away in 2012. Prior to Typhoon Yolanda, I left with my youngest son to seek refuge at my cousin’s home. The walls and roof have gone from my home – only the posts and the walls remain. I have no work, I have no money, and my eldest son cannot support me since he only earns enough to support his own family. When the Red Cross volunteers arrived to provide assistance I was happy because now I can rebuild a house just for me and my ten-year old son. Before, I didn’t have money to afford a carpenter. Now I will request assistance from a carpenter. This is important to us because in time of rain or shine we will have a house to live in; no one can tell us to leave the house because it will be ours.</p>

        <p>My name is Neri. I am a 83-years old and I live in Barangay Banat-i. I am a widow, living alone with occasional support from my son. Before I received assistance of the Red Cross, my house was totally damaged. I had trouble sleeping every night because my house my house was totally damaged. I would sleep in a very small area and I would cover the area with a blanket so that I couldn’t be seen from outside. I felt especially hopeless because my children we also victims of Yolanda. All of us were victims. After Yolanda, Red Cross volunteers came to the barangay and coordinated with officials and with the community. They offered me assistance. I am so happy that I will get assistance because without getting a carpenter I would not be able to build a house. I don't have money for a carpenter. Now I can rebuild my house and I can sleep well. The assistance of the Red Cross makes my life longer because I can sleep well and spend my money on my daily needs like food, instead of having to pay a carpenter. I am very thankful. I hope that the Red Cross will continue to help by giving assistance to those people that need it because God is watching.</p>

        <p>My name is Caridad Patillas Remorta. I am living in Batilisan Bawud, San Isidro with my daughter and her 2 children. I am 79 years old. My house was completely damaged during the typhoon. The roof was gone. After the storm, we built a new small house with very light material. Now the Red Cross gave me assistance. I have received corrugated iron sheets, and my son-in-law will help to fix my house using these materials. Now I can use a stronger material and my new home will be better than the small, weak structure. It will be good for me. I am very grateful to the Red Cross for its assistance. I hope that they may also help me to have better access to medical assistance as well.</p>
