        </div>
        <p>Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013. It was the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall and the scale of devastation was without precedent. The storm affected around 16 million people across a huge swathe of islands – each with their own challenges around access and infrastructure.</p>
        
          <div class="logos"><img class="img-responsive logos-img" src="img/logos2.png"></div>    
        
        <p>The current recovery operation of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement extends across a vast area of five island groups. With over 8,000 community-based volunteers on the ground, we have reached 1.3 million people with emergency relief aid. Our current goal in the recovery phase is to serve 500,000 of the most vulnerable people over the next three years, with a focus on safer shelter and livelihoods. We invite you to take a closer look at the work we have been doing this past year, and meet a number of people we are helping get back on their feet, one year later.</p>

        <img class="pull-left" src="img/livelihoods.png">
        A stable source of income is the foundation for long-term recovery in any disaster. It is also one of the most effective ways to assist communities. Over the past year, the Red Cross has been providing financial assistance to those affected by Typhoon Haiyan. It remains a priority in our ongoing operation, ranging from unconditional cash grants and cash-for-work, to grants that have enabled self-employed people kick-start their business. Our cash programme is making a difference in the lives of people such as <a href="#liporada">Maria</a>, <a href="#martinez">Gaspar</a>, <a href="#cabujoc">Joel</a>, <a href="barroa">Restituto</a>, <a href="#rogan">Estifana</a>, and <a href="#calinao">Fransisco</a>.

        <h2 class="header-name">Maria</h2>
        <p>Mother of two Maria Redubla Liporada loves to make cakes, but it was only when she received about USD130 in livelihood support from Red Cross that she was able to realise her dream to set up a small bakery.</p>         
        <p>Maria and her family live in a remote upland community in Leyte called Anonang, which was hard hit by Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
        <p>The family was evacuated to higher ground before the typhoon to escape flooding from a nearby river.  When they returned, they found their house and belongings gone and most of their crops destroyed. They had very little left to eat. That time was tough for them all, Maria says.</p> 
        <p>‘During that time I felt a mixture of emotions. We had lost everything, but at the same time we were thankful to survive.’</p>
        <p>Not long after that Maria’s family and some other survivors left for Manila to seek a new life. By chance they saw an interview with the Philippine Red Cross chairman, Richard Gordon. He explained what the Red Cross was doing to distribute relief goods to people in need. That gave Maria and her family renewed hope, and they decided to return home. Once recovery work started, they were able to qualify for Red Cross livelihood support.</p>

        <p>These days, Maria gets up at 3 every morning to make her kakanin (cakes) and sells enough to make about USD10 a day. All the family savings go straight into the bank and will be used to rebuild their home and pay school fees.</p>
        <p>‘I want to thank Red Cross for giving me the opportunity to start a new life and a new business,’ she says. ‘My message to other women is: don’t just sit at home – help your husband and together you will prosper.’</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Gaspar</h2>
        <p>Married with four children, Gaspar Martinez is a farmer living in Barangay Villa Corazon of Burauen, Leyte. Before Haiyan, Gaspar earned about 800 pesos every 40 days by planting rice, corn, and root vegetables. Although the earnings barely stretched to meet the basic needs of his family, they were content with what their farm produced.</p>
        <p>Life for Gaspar and his family became extremely difficult after Haiyan, the small nipa hut that the family lived in was destroyed by strong winds and the farm was ruined. They were left with no choice but to move into a tiny shed owned by his in-laws. Forced to search for a new way to sustain his family, Gaspar became frustrated and hopeless. But he kept on searching until one day, when volunteering for the Barangay Recovery Committee, he learned about the Red Cross’ cash grants to help households restart their livelihoods.</p>
        <p>Meeting the requirements, Gaspar and his family were selected as beneficiaries and provided with a 6,000 pesos (USD450) first installment of a conditional cash grant. With the money, Gaspar was able to start a small business buying and selling rice, vegetables, and fish at a little sari-sari store. Through the business, Gaspar is successfully rebuilding his life and providing for his family: his children are studying at Burauen High School, he is planning to save enough money to rebuild the small nipa hut they once called home and more importantly, he no longer has difficulty providing food for his family.</p>
        <p>Gaspar is now looking forward to brighter days and he has an inspirational message for others affected by the calamity: “Make use of the Red Cross’ livelihoods grants. Care for your family. A big, big thanks to the Philippine Red Cross Livelihood Program.”</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Joel</h2>
        <p>Joel Cabujoc is a young entrepreneur from Barangay Santol of San Miguel, Leyte. Before Haiyan, Joel’s family had a bamboo furniture business and was doing well: a good trade selling in their nearby market kept them busy and the income kept them well fed. After Haiyan destroyed the business, Joel and his family were left feeling deeply hopeless. Though Joel found pay as a farmhand and worked hard to provide for them and restore their lives the family still struggled.</p> 
        <p>Joel’s application to the Philippine Red Cross for a for a livelihood grant was successful. With the 8,000 pesos (USD590) received he was able to revive his family business. Now, with enough orders, he is able to generate up to 2,500 pesos (USD180) per week. Each day, he personally harvests bamboo and goes to the local market to purchase materials. With pride, Joel has been able to save some money to rebuild his house and pay a farm labourer to tend the farm and pay him with a sack of rice when the harvest is ready. Joel Cabujoc and his family are happy and thankful.</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Restituto</h2>
        <p>Restituto B. Barroa is a 69 year-old resident of Ilawod Daga, Panay, Capiz and a tentant farmer. He is married to Elisa, and owns less than 1 hectare of cultivated land. Restituto has a famous reputation as an industrious man in his village, or barangay.</p>
        <p>When Typhoon Haiyan struck one year ago, it left Restituto’s farm in a dire condition. Although he could fix his house using salvaged materials, his source of family income - rice farming - was unsalvageable. And given his age, Restituto had no other source of income.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Red Cross selected the Barroa family to take part in their Livelihood Recovery Program, based on a nomination from the community. With the support he received from the Red Cross, Restituto is farming rice and the local bitter squash, “ampalaya.” He also purchased a pig. With a second payment, he bought 40 ducklings and another piglet.</p>
        <p>Now Restituto’s animals are growing, he sell his vegetables in their barangay and he already harvested 100 sacks of rice. From the income he generated, Restituto bought three more piglets and a few ducks.</p>

        <p>“Gapasalamat guid ko sa dako nga bulig nga ginhatag sang Philippine Red Cross kag gamiton ko ini sa insakto,” says Restituto, which roughly translates as “I am very thankful for what the Philippine Red Cross has given me. I promise I will use it properly.”</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Estifana</h2>
        <p>Tenant farmer Estifana Rogan, 72, works hard hoeing the fertile soil in her family’s fruit and vegetable plantation. Estifana lives with her husband, Bermijo, and one adult son, who has Down’s syndrome.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" onclick="callImageModal(this);">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/rogan-1_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Pineapples, bananas, eggplants, sweet potatoes and green peppers flourish in this secluded valley in the inland barangay (village) of Ogsip, Libacao, on Panay Island.</p>
        <p>It’s hard to believe that a year ago typhoon Haiyan wiped out nearly everything the Rogans had. The roof of their house was blown off, a wall collapsed and all their poultry was killed. Luckily, everyone in the Rogan household survived the horrific storm.</p>
        <p>Estifana says she used to worry how the family would survive without a source of food or income, apart from the emergency relief aid they received from Red Cross.</p>
        <p>Because of their difficult circumstances the family was selected by the local community’s barangay recovery committee for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s conditional cash for livelihoods programme, which offers up to 10,000 pesos (USD220) per household.</p>
        <div class="modalLink-half" onclick="callImageModal(this);"><img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/rogan-2_small.jpg"></div>

        <p>‘With the 10,000 pesos we bought seedlings and fertilizers and we started to replant,’ Estifana says. It took the elderly couple 10 days to plant their crops and almost a month before the first fruit appeared. Now they hope to get back on their feet.</p>
        <p>‘We will save money and store food so that our house is already prepared for the next typhoon,’ Estifana says with a smile.</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Fransisco</h2>
        <p>50 year-old Francisco Calinao is one of many survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, whose primary source of income was lost as a result of the disaster. With his 80 year-old mother and 19 year-old daughter to care for, Francisco began selling produce from his backyard to the nearby market so the family could meet their daily needs, including expenses for his daughter's schooling.</p>
        <p>Things changed for the better when Francisco was selected to be part of the Philippine Red Cross' Household Livelihood Assistance programme. As a landless laborer with a very small garden, when he received the 1st installment of 6,000 pesos (USD145), Francisco began planting variety of vegetables. He also purchased fingerling Tilapia for his small pond, in order to maximize productivity and supplement his garden’s income. </p>
        <img class="img-double-sm" src="img/francisco-1.jpg">
        <img class="img-double-sm" src="img/francisco-2.jpg"> 
        <p>While it is too early to assess the success of his investment to date, Francisco is grateful to the Philippine Red Cross for the assistance. It has given his entire family a solid opportunity to be more financially secure than before.</p>
        <p>“Gapasalamat ako sa ginbulig sang Philippine Red Cross tungod kay nakaumpisa ako liwat sa pangabuhi na mas maayo pa," says Francisco.</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">The Coconut Lady</h2>
        <p>Irene, her husband Elmer and six young children fled for their lives when Typhoon Haiyan tore through their community and their house was destroyed.  They ended up taking refuge on the Palo beachfront, along with hundreds of other people who had lost everything and had nowhere else to go.</p>
        <p>But a year later, thanks to the 5,000 pesos (USD110) Red Cross emergency cash relief Irene received in February, the Colleras have bounced back. Irene has become the ‘buko shack lady’, complete with billboard and a thriving small business selling fresh coconut juice. </p>
        <p>Irene explains that before Haiyan, many women from her community would sell sari sari (variety) goods. But very few people make a profit, because so many neighbours and friends ask for credit.</p>
        <p>So Irene saved 1,000 pesos for house repairs and cannily invested the rest to buy 1,200 coconuts from a passing farmer. She repeated this every week until she had saved enough to rebuild her house, setting aside enough to cover health costs and school expenses.</p> 
        <p>Life is good, she says, because now her children get enough to eat and she’s making enough to employ two helpers and open another stall. 'My family are very happy and hopefully my business will keep growing,’ she says with a smile.</p>

        <p>During Typhoon Yolanda, I felt like it was the last day of my life because of the strong winds. Yolanda broke my house. During the typhoon, we did not come to any rehabilitation centre, we just stayed at the house. All my chickens died. My vegetable plants were gone. That just scared me most; not for only myself, but also my children, and my wife.</p>
        <p>Now, I am very happy because of the shelter assistance that I received. I am happy because for the first time, I can repair my house. My family is more secure.  With these corrugated iron sheets, for the first time since Yolanda I have a roof over our heads. Without these iron sheets, we would still have no roof – only tarpaulins.</p> 
        <p>With this assistance from the Red Cross, I can now use my own money to buy food for my family. I do not need to spend that money to repair my home. Now I can see the Red Cross has the ability and the power to help Filipino people that need assistance.</p>

        <p>My name is Misalina Cabalquinto Jubos. I am a widow with two children – one is ten years old and another has his own family. My first husband left me when I lost my hand in a car accident while I was going to the hospital to immunize our son. My second husband passed away in 2012. Prior to Typhoon Yolanda, I left with my youngest son to seek refuge at my cousin’s home. The walls and roof have gone from my home – only the posts and the walls remain. I have no work, I have no money, and my eldest son cannot support me since he only earns enough to support his own family. When the Red Cross volunteers arrived to provide assistance I was happy because now I can rebuild a house just for me and my ten-year old son. Before, I didn’t have money to afford a carpenter. Now I will request assistance from a carpenter. This is important to us because in time of rain or shine we will have a house to live in; no one can tell us to leave the house because it will be ours.</p>

        <p>My name is Neri. I am a 83-years old and I live in Barangay Banat-i. I am a widow, living alone with occasional support from my son. Before I received assistance of the Red Cross, my house was totally damaged. I had trouble sleeping every night because my house my house was totally damaged. I would sleep in a very small area and I would cover the area with a blanket so that I couldn’t be seen from outside. I felt especially hopeless because my children we also victims of Yolanda. All of us were victims. After Yolanda, Red Cross volunteers came to the barangay and coordinated with officials and with the community. They offered me assistance. I am so happy that I will get assistance because without getting a carpenter I would not be able to build a house. I don't have money for a carpenter. Now I can rebuild my house and I can sleep well. The assistance of the Red Cross makes my life longer because I can sleep well and spend my money on my daily needs like food, instead of having to pay a carpenter. I am very thankful. I hope that the Red Cross will continue to help by giving assistance to those people that need it because God is watching.</p>

        <p>My name is Caridad Patillas Remorta. I am living in Batilisan Bawud, San Isidro with my daughter and her 2 children. I am 79 years old. My house was completely damaged during the typhoon. The roof was gone. After the storm, we built a new small house with very light material. Now the Red Cross gave me assistance. I have received corrugated iron sheets, and my son-in-law will help to fix my house using these materials. Now I can use a stronger material and my new home will be better than the small, weak structure. It will be good for me. I am very grateful to the Red Cross for its assistance. I hope that they may also help me to have better access to medical assistance as well.</p>

        <p>During the aftermath of disasters, local labourers are hired to construct local shelters to assist their livelihood twofold. Pictured here is a PRC/IFRC shelter construction team in Tabontabon, Leyte. They are hired to fulfill the IFRC’s specifications for shelters and are paid the equivalent of a government mandated wage according to their skill level, which is about USD11 for skilled labourers and USD6.70 for unskilled.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" onclick="callImageModal(this);">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery2-1_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Some labourers are direct beneficiaries of the construction projects and will move into the very shelter that is under construction. Most beneficiaries are expected to contribute their own labour to build their house if they are capable of doing so. This sort of exchange (or is transaction a better word?) is called ‘sweat equity’. Some beneficiaries are paid in food vouchers if not money.</p>

        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery2-2_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Skilled labourers such as masons and carpenters are in high demand to build homes to IFRC's specifications. This is the inside of a 'core' shelter in an inland village in Leyte, The householder is also involved in the construction by contributing 'sweat equity' to the project.</p>

        <p>Once the shelter is finished, the occupant can move in. Homes built by IFRC south of Tacloban have a concrete 'core' and timber frame, topped with high specification CGI sheets. This is one of the earliest models and the family occupying it have added on a shaded porch area complete with concrete pillars built to the same specs as the house pillars.</p>

        <p>Building shelters for vulnerable persons is, at a glance, more tedious than difficult – the challenge lies within gathering the building materials, transporting them, mobilizing staff and volunteers, and coordinating with the local government and community. Once the administrative tasks are accomplished, the building process begins with the unloading of the truck.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" style="cursor:auto;">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery1-1_large.jpg"></div>
        <p>The next step is to process and prepare the land to properly accommodate the foundation of the shelter. This includes clearing the area of shrubbery and leveling the land so as to prevent the shelter from falling over. </p>
        <div class="modalLink" style="cursor:auto;">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery1-2_large.jpg"></div>
        <p>Once the task is done, the base of the shelter is laid on top of the foundation.  This particular base is suspended above the ground as a safeguard from small floods. </p>
        <div class="modalLink" style="cursor:auto;">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery1-3_large.jpg"></div>
        <p>The frames are assembled following the establishment of the shelter’s base. </p>
        <div class="modalLink" style="cursor:auto;">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery1-4_large.jpg"></div>
        <p>Once the frames are finished, the full construction of the floor, walls, and roof begins. There are no additional rooms to this shelter. The living space may be divided as the occupants wish.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" style="cursor:auto;">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery1-5_large.jpg"></div>

        <h2 class="header-name">Reflections: Irma</h2>
        <p>Living next to the beach in south Tacloban for many decades, Irma Cruz Roasa, a retired director of nursing, is used to strong storms.  Over her lifetime, the city has been battered by bad weather. Despite this, she wasn’t prepared for what happened early on the morning of November 8 last year, when a large dredger washed up on the beach just two metres from her house.</p>
        <p>“It had been raining all night and we knew it was a typhoon signal 3 (the second highest Philippine category of storm warning), but no-one understood what ‘surge’ meant.” Looking out the window that morning with Irma, was her daughter Helen. Helen had delivered a baby the night before at the hospital, but had decided  not to stay overnight because she was worried about her mother. She had returned home, despite the bad storm.</p>
        <p>The storm intensified overnight – water came pouring through the door so fast that they barely had time to react. It rapidly reached the upper floor, taking all the furniture with it.</p>
        <p>"We could hear the wind howling and the most of the roof came off... The next thing we knew, we saw a dredger outside! We thought it was a rescue ship sent by the Department of Works and Highways, but then we could hear people on the boat shouting at us to jump.</p>
        <p>“One of the house helpers kicked through the ceiling. We all got to the roof and I remember standing there in gale-force winds, holding on to the trusses as we waited for the wind to calm. My daughter Helen was the last one to come up. Even though neither of us could swim, we somehow managed to clamber aboard the boat.</p>
        <p>“We were there for five hours with all these other people. It was very cold and wet. By the time we left the boat about 200 people had arrived.”</p>
        <p>The first few months after the typhoon were extremely harrowing. “That time was sad and unforgettable. Everyone was affected, rich and poor. Dengue was rife because there weren’t enough people to collect garbage”, recalls Irma. And what of the ‘Noah’s Ark’ that sheltered them from the storm? A year after Haiyan, it’s still beside the house. “I wonder how they will remove it?” asks Helen.</p>

        <p>Close friends Luzviminda 'Lucy' Pido and Angie Lopez live in Barangay Tacuranga, Palo, Leyte. Lucy and her husband, Joel, have six children. Angie and her husband, Prodito, have 17 children.</p>
        <p>Lucy and Angie are proud and happy to have been working for the Philippines Red Cross for nearly a year. Their jobs have secured them a stable income, a factor which has made a big difference in helping them and their respective  families get back on their feet after Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
        <p>Casting her mind back to November last year, Angie says she will never forget hiding from Haiyan in a small toilet at the local evacuation centre. "I was really scared because some of the people in my family got separated," says Angie. "I took the eight of the children with me to the evacuation centre at the school and we ended up with a lot of other families in a toilet that was only big enough for one person. I had my baby with me and he would cry because we were all so squashed."</p>
        <p>"When I saw my husband again after the typhoon we were so grateful to see one another."</p>
        <p>Lucy says even though Filipinos are used to typhoons it wasn't until she survived Haiyan that she realised just how lucky she and the family had been compared to the many others who died. So when the barangay captain asked if they were interested in working for Red Cross, they both jumped at the chance.</p> 
        <p>"Without Yolanda (Haiyan) I wouldn't have gotten a job like this, where I get to know different people and meet some from other countries. It's the best thing that's happened to my life," says Lucy.</p>

        <p>My name is Edelin (Lin) Yepa Amparo. I was working in Fort Bonifacio when I heard about the Typhoon that hit Leyte. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed to find my family. After a difficult journey I was able to find my them: they were not okay. Their home had been washed away, my father was killed, my pregnant sister and one of her sons had all been killed.</p>
        <p>I felt very hopeless. Until now, my mother still cannot talk to us properly – she hasn't gotten over what happened to our family. My two nieces and my son, whom I later brought from Leyte to Manila, are still very afraid every time they hear strong winds in Manila. They ask me if it is going to be a typhoon, but I always assure to them that it is nothing.</p> 
        <p>The Barangay Chairman, aware of my situation, selected me to attend the Red Cross programme since he believes the training and knowledge will prevent further tragedy from affecting my family. Through this experience, I have learnt about preparedness and my fear of typhoons has lessened. While I'm not yet fully prepared, and emotionally I'm not wholly ready to cope with disaster, I feel positive that this will not happen again to our family.</p>
        <p>In the future, I hope the Red Cross will communicate more with people affected by disasters. I would feel better if the Red Cross confirms the right information, and also informs us if our families are safe or not. We are always worried that we need to go to our families, and we don’t know that they have been helped or not. This could make us feel at ease.</p>
