        <p>Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013. It was the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall and the scale of devastation was without precedent. The storm affected around 16 million people across a huge swathe of islands – each with their own challenges around access and infrastructure.</p>  
        
        <p>The current recovery operation of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement extends across a vast area of five island groups. With over 8,000 community-based volunteers on the ground, we have reached 1.3 million people with emergency relief aid. Our current goal in the recovery phase is to serve 500,000 of the most vulnerable people over the next three years, with a focus on safer shelter and livelihoods. We invite you to take a closer look at the work we have been doing this past year, and meet a number of people we are helping get back on their feet, one year later.</p>

        <img class="pull-left" src="img/livelihoods.png">
        A stable source of income is the foundation for long-term recovery in any disaster. It is also one of the most effective ways to assist communities. Over the past year, the Red Cross has been providing financial assistance to those affected by Typhoon Haiyan. It remains a priority in our ongoing operation, ranging from unconditional cash grants and cash-for-work, to grants that have enabled self-employed people kick-start their business. Our cash programme is making a difference in the lives of people such as <a href="#liporada">Maria</a>, <a href="#martinez">Gaspar</a>, <a href="#cabujoc">Joel</a>, and <a href="#coconutlady">Irene</a>.

        <h2 class="header-name">Maria</h2>
        <p>Mother of two Maria Redubla Liporada loves to make cakes, but it was only when she received about USD130 in livelihood support from Red Cross that she was able to realise her dream to set up a small bakery.</p>         
        <p>Maria and her family live in a remote upland community in Leyte called Anonang, which was hard hit by Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
        <p>The family was evacuated to higher ground before the typhoon to escape flooding from a nearby river.  When they returned, they found their house and belongings gone and most of their crops destroyed. They had very little left to eat. That time was tough for them all, Maria says.</p> 
        <p>‘During that time I felt a mixture of emotions. We had lost everything, but at the same time we were thankful to survive.’</p>
        <p>Not long after that Maria’s family and some other survivors left for Manila to seek a new life. By chance they saw an interview with the Philippine Red Cross chairman, Richard Gordon. He explained what the Red Cross was doing to distribute relief goods to people in need. That gave Maria and her family renewed hope, and they decided to return home. Once recovery work started, they were able to qualify for Red Cross livelihood support.</p>

        <div class="modalLink-half" onclick="callImageModal(this);"><img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/liporada-3_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>These days, Maria gets up at 3 every morning to make her kakanin (cakes) and sells enough to make about USD10 a day. All the family savings go straight into the bank and will be used to rebuild their home and pay school fees.</p>
        <p>‘I want to thank Red Cross for giving me the opportunity to start a new life and a new business,’ she says. ‘My message to other women is: don’t just sit at home – help your husband and together you will prosper.’</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Gaspar</h2>
        <p>Married with four children, Gaspar Martinez is a farmer living in Barangay Villa Corazon of Burauen, Leyte. Before Haiyan, Gaspar earned about 800 pesos every 40 days by planting rice, corn, and root vegetables. Although the earnings barely stretched to meet the basic needs of his family, they were content with what their farm produced.</p>
        <p>Life for Gaspar and his family became extremely difficult after Haiyan, the small nipa hut that the family lived in was destroyed by strong winds and the farm was ruined. They were left with no choice but to move into a tiny shed owned by his in-laws. Forced to search for a new way to sustain his family, Gaspar became frustrated and hopeless. But he kept on searching until one day, when volunteering for the Barangay Recovery Committee, he learned about the Red Cross’ cash grants to help households restart their livelihoods.</p>
        <p>Meeting the requirements, Gaspar and his family were selected as beneficiaries and provided with a 6,000 pesos (USD450) first installment of a conditional cash grant. With the money, Gaspar was able to start a small business buying and selling rice, vegetables, and fish at a little sari-sari store. Through the business, Gaspar is successfully rebuilding his life and providing for his family: his children are studying at Burauen High School, he is planning to save enough money to rebuild the small nipa hut they once called home and more importantly, he no longer has difficulty providing food for his family.</p>
        <p>Gaspar is now looking forward to brighter days and he has an inspirational message for others affected by the calamity: “Make use of the Red Cross’ livelihoods grants. Care for your family. A big, big thanks to the Philippine Red Cross Livelihood Program.”</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Joel</h2>
        <p>Joel Cabujoc is a young entrepreneur from Barangay Santol of San Miguel, Leyte. Before Haiyan, Joel’s family had a bamboo furniture business and was doing well: a good trade selling in their nearby market kept them busy and the income kept them well fed. After Haiyan destroyed the business, Joel and his family were left feeling deeply hopeless. Though Joel found pay as a farmhand and worked hard to provide for them and restore their lives the family still struggled.</p> 
        <p>Joel’s application to the Philippine Red Cross for a for a livelihood grant was successful. With the 8,000 pesos (USD590) received he was able to revive his family business. Now, with enough orders, he is able to generate up to 2,500 pesos (USD180) per week. Each day, he personally harvests bamboo and goes to the local market to purchase materials. With pride, Joel has been able to save some money to rebuild his house and pay a farm labourer to tend the farm and pay him with a sack of rice when the harvest is ready. Joel Cabujoc and his family are happy and thankful.</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">The Coconut Lady</h2>
        <p>Irene Collera, her husband Elmer and six young children fled for their lives when Typhoon Haiyan tore through their community and their house was destroyed.  They ended up taking refuge on the Palo beachfront, along with hundreds of other people who had lost everything and had nowhere else to go.</p>

        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/irene-1_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>But a year later, thanks to the 5,000 pesos (USD110) Red Cross emergency cash relief Irene received in February, the Colleras have bounced back. Irene has become the ‘buko shack lady’, complete with billboard and a thriving small business selling fresh coconut juice. </p>

        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/irene-3_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Irene explains that before Haiyan, many women from her community would sell sari sari (variety) goods. But very few people make a profit, because so many neighbours and friends ask for credit.</p>

        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/irene-2_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>So Irene saved 1,000 pesos for house repairs and cannily invested the rest to buy 1,200 coconuts from a passing farmer. She repeated this every week until she had saved enough to rebuild her house, setting aside enough to cover health costs and school expenses.</p>

        <div class="modalLink-half" onclick="callImageModal(this);"><img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/irene-5_small.jpg"></div> 
        <p>Life is good, she says, because now her children get enough to eat and she’s making enough to employ two helpers and open another stall. 'My family are very happy and hopefully my business will keep growing,’ she says with a smile.</p>

        <h2 class="header-name">Shelter</h2>
        <img class="pull-left" src="img/shelter.png">
        <p>Shelter is the foundation for long-term recovery after a disaster. It not only provides protection from the elements, it also gives families privacy, dignity and safety. In the immediate aftermath of the typhoon, the Red Cross provided nearly 624,000 people with emergency shelter assistance. This is almost one-in-four households in the affected region. The Red Cross is addressing longer-term shelter needs by building homes, as well as enabling communities to rebuild on their own with corrugated iron sheets, repair kits and cash grants.</p>
        <p>Volunteers have been trained to support communities on building hazards and safety for sustainable reconstruction. The current goal is to provide assistance for 50,000 households and 40,000 new homes over the next three years. The Red Cross remains committed to scaling-up its efforts as quickly as possible to meet the remaining needs in communities.

        <h2 class="header-name">Building Back</h2>
        <p>During the aftermath of disasters, local labourers are hired to construct local shelters to assist their livelihood twofold. Pictured here is a PRC/IFRC shelter construction team in Tabontabon, Leyte. They are hired to fulfill the IFRC’s specifications for shelters and are paid the equivalent of a government mandated wage according to their skill level, which is about USD11 for skilled labourers and USD6.70 for unskilled.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" onclick="callImageModal(this);">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery2-1_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Some labourers are direct beneficiaries of the construction projects and will move into the very shelter that is under construction. Most beneficiaries are expected to contribute their own labour to build their house if they are capable of doing so. This sort of exchange (or is transaction a better word?) is called ‘sweat equity’. Some beneficiaries are paid in food vouchers if not money.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" onclick="callImageModal(this);">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery2-2_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Skilled labourers such as masons and carpenters are in high demand to build homes to IFRC's specifications. This is the inside of a 'core' shelter in an inland village in Leyte, The householder is also involved in the construction by contributing 'sweat equity' to the project.</p>
        <div class="modalLink" onclick="callImageModal(this);">
        <img class="modalLinkImg img-responsive" src="img/gallery2-3_small.jpg"></div>
        <p>Once the shelter is finished, the occupant can move in. Homes built by IFRC south of Tacloban have a concrete 'core' and timber frame, topped with high specification CGI sheets. This is one of the earliest models and the family occupying it have added on a shaded porch area complete with concrete pillars built to the same specs as the house pillars.</p>
